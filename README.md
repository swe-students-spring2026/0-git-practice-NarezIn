#### The following is my work:
I want to share a course web site called **The Missing Semester of Your CS Education** taught by **MIT**. Here is the link of the 2026 version: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/
- I find this course interesting because they introduce students with several helpful tools that are usually not taught in the early stage of their university curriculum or at all.
- Some tools that I found useful / good to know are Vim, Git/Github, Data Wrangling as a CS and DS major.
- Thoughts about *Vim*: 
    - Even though I am not quite proficient in using *Vim*, I do find this way of editing files with keeping your hands around the center of your keyboard interesting and it can be efficient if you are familiar with it.
    - Custimizing my own *Vim configuration* is also fun.
- The syllabus of this course evolves quickly as the tech world evolves. For example, the latest version of this course removed *Vim* but added *Agentic Coding*.
